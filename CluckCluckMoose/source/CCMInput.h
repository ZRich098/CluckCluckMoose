//  CCM Demo
//
//  This input controller is primarily designed for mouse control.  On mobile
//  you will notice that we use a two finger pan gesture to emulate this.
//  While the use of the mouse necessitates additional state for tracking movement,
//  our PanInput class does not use such state, and can set _pandelta directly.

/**
* This class represents player input in the CCM demo.
*
* This input handler uses the CUGL input API.  It uses the polling API for
* keyboard, but the callback API for touch.  This demonstrates a mix of ways
* to handle input, and the reason for hiding it behind an abstraction like
* this class.
*
* Unlike CUGL input devices, this class is not a singleton.  It must be
* allocated before use.  However, you will notice that we do not do any
* input initialization in the constructor.  This allows us to allocate this
* controller as a field without using pointers. We simply add the class to the
* header file of its owner, and delay initialization (via the method init())
* until later. This is one of the main reasons we like to avoid initialization
* in the constructor.
